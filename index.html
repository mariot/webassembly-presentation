							If you want to alter your website, do some calculation or any programming you could only do it with JS. Now you can use other languages

							Binary format, compact, fast load, portable because it can run on any browser, secure.
							Does not replace JS
							Build high performance web applications
							Rounds around 1.2 to 1.5 times than a native speed

							The web was in infancy back then. It was simple: everything was on a remote server, and every time your wanted something new, you had to ask for it.

							But even then, people wanted to write applications for the web. Then knew it was the future and wanted to be part of the community that would sharpen it.

							When talking about WebAssembly, you might have a sense of déjà-vu. Compiling other languages for the Web, haven't we tried that before?

							Java was not present in Windows by default, or other devices.

							Flash, Silverlight and HTML5 began to emerge.

						<p>....until JavaScript</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							It became the language used for the web due to being optimized for mobile devices, did not require installing additional things, present in all architectures.

							Since you are all web developers, I don't need to present this to you. It became the brick and mortar of the web. Everyone and their moms could now develop for the web.

							And a big plus for JavaScript was the arrival of AJAX. It was revolutionnary. Not need to reload anymore, you can browse in peace and the heavy lifting would be done by other applications, stored in a server far away.

							Javascript was never designed to be fast and browsers
